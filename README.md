# 📸 FaceTrack

FaceTrack is a Python-based **Face Tracking + Face Recognition** project that can detect and recognize faces in real-time using a webcam.  
It allows you to **register new faces**, **train the model**, and then **identify people live**.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Real-time face detection using webcam  
✅ Register new faces (create your own dataset)  
✅ Train a face recognition model  
✅ Recognize known faces + show **Unknown** for others  
✅ Simple and beginner-friendly project structure
